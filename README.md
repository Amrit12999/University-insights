Technologies Used:

* JavaScript: (for basic functionality interactive elements, etc.)

Setup:
1. Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
2. Customize the content, styling, and form handling as needed.
3. For the form to work, you will need server-side code to handle the form submissions (e.g., using PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.).  The current `action="#" ` means the form will submit to the same page, but do nothing.  You'll need to change this.
